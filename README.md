# MA1008-Project-Introduction-To-Computational-Thinking

## Objective: Python application for computing reaction forces in beams, incorporating user inputs for different load configurations

- Employed Turtle graphics to create visual representations of beam diagrams and generated graphs illustrating shear 
force and bending moment distributions
